# End-to-End-Web-Application-for-Fake-News-Detection

One of the most harmful aspects of social media applications is the propagation of bogus news. To build an end-to-end application for detecting fake news, we first train a machine learning model that can tell us if a piece of information is authentic or fake just by analyzingÂ the headline in the news. After we peform end-to-end deployment, we use the streamlit library in Python to build an end-to-end application for the machine learning model to detect fake news in real-time.

ML Model - Naive Bayes (Multimonial)

Deployment - Streamlit
